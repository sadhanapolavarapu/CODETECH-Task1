**OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT
**
**PROJECT : DATA PROCESSING
**
**OBJECTIVE 
**
_The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline to enhance the quality and suitability of raw data for AI model training. This pipeline addresses common issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats while enabling efficient data transformation and normalization. By sharing this project on GitHub, we aim to provide a robust framework that is reusable and adaptable for various datasets, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in preprocessing steps. We also seek to encourage community collaboration to keep the pipeline up-to-date with best practices and new techniques. Ultimately, this project aims to streamline the data preparation process, making it easier to apply machine learning algorithms effectively.

**KEY ACTIVITES 
**
Import Necessary Libraries: Load essential Python libraries required for data preprocessing.
Read Dataset: Load the dataset into a DataFrame for analysis.
Sanity Check of Data: Verify data integrity by checking for inconsistencies and anomalies.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships.
Missing Value Treatments: Handle missing values by imputing or removing them.
Outlier Treatments: Identify and manage outliers to prevent skewed analysis.
Duplicates and Garbage Value Treatments: Remove duplicate entries and irrelevant values from the dataset.
Encoding of Data: Convert categorical variables into numerical format for model compatibility.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED 
**
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and preprocessing tasks.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for reading, cleaning, and transforming data.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization libraries used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns and relationships.
Google Colab: An interactive, cloud-based environment for writing and running Python code, particularly useful for data analysis and preprocessing.
